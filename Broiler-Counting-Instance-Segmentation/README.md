## üöÄ Getting Started

### Requirements

1. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install ultralytics opencv-python numpy matplotlib pillow pyyaml
```

2. For Google Colab usage, run the notebooks directly - all dependencies will be installed automatically.

### Running the Notebooks

1. **Instance Segmentation Approach** (`BroilerCounting.ipynb`):
   - Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter
   - Follow the cells sequentially to train YOLOv8s-seg model

2. **Object Detection Approach** (`BroilerCounting(ObjectDetection).ipynb`):
   - Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter
   - Train YOLOv8n model for object detection
   - Includes training, validation, and interactive inference with image upload

### Quick Start Example

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load pre-trained or trained model
model = YOLO('yolov8s-seg.pt')  # or 'best.pt' after training

# Run inference
results = model.predict(
    source='path/to/chicken/images',
    conf=0.89,
    save=True
)

# Get count
chicken_count = len(results[0].boxes)
print(f"Detected {chicken_count} chickens")
```
